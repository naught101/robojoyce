# Town location Notes

Candidate towns are all of the Urban Centres & Locations in the 2011 ABS ASGS hierarchy, except for the ones not associated with a particular location (no usual address, state/territory remainders, shipping ones). We skipped the available UCL-to-SA1 correspondences, as most public Census data is provided at SA2 level. Instead, we calculated the centroids of the UCLs in QGIS and then calculated which SA2 each centroid fell into. We used this to associate each town with an SA2.
